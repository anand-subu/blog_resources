{"question": "Background:\nSome patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.\nMethods:\nIn this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab.

{"question": "Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1\u00df, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis.

{"question": "A 40-year-old man comes to the emergency department with a 4-day history of left leg pain. Over the weekend, he scraped his left thigh when he fell on a muddy field while playing flag football with some friends. Since that time, he has had progressively worsening redness and pain in his left thigh. Past medical history is unremarkable. His temperature is 39.4\u00b0C (103.0\u00b0F), heart rate is 120/min, and blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg. Physical exam is significant for a poorly-demarcated area of redness on his left thigh, extending to about a 10 cm radius from a small scrape. This area is extremely tender to palpation, and palpation elicits an unusual 'crunchy' sensation. CT scan shows free air in the soft tissue of the left leg. The organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation is also a common cause of which of the following conditions?", "answer": "Food-borne illness", "options": {"A": "Bacterial pneumonia", "B": "Bacterial sinusitis", "C": "Food-borne illness", "D": "Urinary tract infection"}, "meta_info": "step2&3", "answer_idx": "C", "metamap_phrases": ["40 year old man", "emergency department", "4-day history", "left leg pain", "weekend", "scraped", "left thigh", "fell", "muddy field", "playing flag football", "friends", "Since", "time", "worsening redness", "pain in", "left thigh", "Past medical history", "unremarkable", "temperature", "4C", "heart rate", "min", "blood pressure", "95 60 mm Hg", "Physical exam", "significant", "poorly", "area", "redness", "left thigh", "extending to", "10", "radius", "small scrape", "area", "extremely tender", "palpation", "palpation elicits", "unusual", "sensation", "CT scan shows free air", "soft tissue", "left leg", "organism", "most likely responsible", "patient's presentation", "common cause", "following conditions"]}
{"question": "In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?", "answer": "Lack of risk calculation", "options": {"A": "No prevalence assessment", "B": "Low number of patients", "C": "Ascertainment bias", "D": "Lack of risk calculation"}, "meta_info": "step1", "answer_idx": "D", "metamap_phrases": ["order to assess", "evaluate", "outcomes", "cerclage wiring", "supportive approach", "osteosynthesis", "femur fractures", "a group", "orthopedic surgeons studied", "patients", "primary", "periprosthetic fractures of", "thigh bone", "Parameters", "as patient demographic", "type of implant", "number of wires used", "fracture union rate", "potential complications", "recorded", "analyzed", "patients", "mean duration", "patient follow-up", "months", "Union", "patients", "mean duration", "90 days", "complications found", "patients included", "study", "authors", "satisfied", "findings", "due to", "prospective nature", "research", "submitted", "study", "journal", "cohort study", "noted", "study title", "well", "journal editor returned", "article", "suggesting", "submitted", "case series", "editor made", "suggestion", "authors", "following reasons"]}
{"question": "A 56-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor with intermittent chest pain. He reports a 2-month history of exertional chest pain that commonly arises after walking 5 or more blocks. He describes the pain as dull, burning, non-radiating substernal pain. His past medical history is notable for hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. He takes simvastatin and losartan. His temperature is 98.9\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 150/85 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, he is well-appearing and in no acute distress.
